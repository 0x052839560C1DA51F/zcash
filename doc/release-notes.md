release-notes at release time)

Notable changes
===============

Option handling
---------------

- The `-reindex` and `-reindex-chainstate` options now imply `-rescan`
  (provided that the wallet is enabled and pruning is disabled, and unless
  `-rescan=0` is specified explicitly).

Build system
------------

- `zcutil/build.sh` now automatically runs `zcutil/clean.sh` to remove
  files created by previous builds. We previously recommended to do this
  manually.

Dependencies
------------

- The `boost` and `native_b2` dependencies have been updated to version 1.79.0

Tests
-----

- The environment variable that allows users of the rpc (Python) tests to
  override the default path to the `zcashd` executable has been changed
  from `BITCOIND` to `ZCASHD`.
