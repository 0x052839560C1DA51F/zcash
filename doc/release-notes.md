Notable changes
===============

Option handling
---------------

- A new `-preferredtxversion` argument allows the node to preferentially create
  transactions of a specified version, if a transaction does not contain
  components that necessitate creation with a specific version. For example,
  setting `-preferredtxversion=4` will cause the node to create V4 transactions
  whenever the transaction does not contain Orchard components. This can be
  helpful if recipients of transactions are likely to be using legacy wallets
  that have not yet been upgraded to support parsing V5 transactions.
